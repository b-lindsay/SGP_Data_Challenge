    "The aim is to test you python abilities. The challenge is to analyze the data provided and answer the questions below. You can use any library you want to help you with the analysis. The data is from the SailGP event in Auckland 2025. The data is in the 'DATA' folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various sources available.\n",

    "The Boat Logs are in the 'Boat_Logs' folder. The data is in csv format and the columns are described in the 'Boat_Logs/Boat_Logs_Columns.csv' file.\n",
    "The 'Course_Marks_2025-01-19.csv' file contains the mark positions and wind reading on the course for the whole day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Race_XML folder contains the xml files for each race that contains information on where the boundaries of the course are, the theoretical position of the marks and the target racecourse axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2025-01-19_man_summary.csv file contains the metrics from the manoeuvre summary for the day.\n",

    "Both are derived from the boat logs.\n",

    "The 2502 m8_APW_HSB2_HSRW.kph.csv file contains the polar data for the boats in that config.\n",

    "## Requierements\n",
    "- Chose at least 3 questions from the list below to answer.\n",
    "- Python 3.8 or higher\n",
    "- Notebook should be able to run without any errors from start to finish.\n",
    "- Specify the libraries (imports) used in the notebook.\n",
    "- Any comments to make the notebook self-explanatory and easy to follow would be appreciated.\n",
    "- If you can't get to the end of a question, we would appreciate the code you have written so far and explain what you were trying to do.\n",
